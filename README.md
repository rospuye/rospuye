# Hi there 👋

## About me

My name is Isabel Rosário, I'm a passionate software developer currently working with Three.js in Aveiro, Portugal, and I have a deep love for all things computer graphics. With a background in Informatics Engineering and over 2 years of academic and professional experience in Three.js, I'm on a mission to make the digital world a more visually appealing place. By day, I create immersive web experiences, and by night, I dive into the realms of UX design, the demoscene, and more!

My curiosity knows no bounds, and I'm always exploring new horizons in computer graphics, whether it's for the web or beyond!

## My expertise

- 🚀 **Web graphics**: I'm your go-to person for crafting jaw-dropping visuals using Three.js. From interactive web applications to stunning animations, I've got it covered.
- 🎨 **UX Design**: I'm constantly enhancing my skills in UX design to create user-centric experiences that not only look good but also feel intuitive.
- 🌐 **3D World**: Unity and Blender are my playgrounds when I'm not tinkering with the web. I enjoy creating 3D worlds, characters, and animations just for fun.

## What I bring to the table

- 🚀 A blend of academic knowledge and real-world experience.
- 💼 Multiple full-fledged projects, showcasing my dedication and expertise.
- 🧠 An insatiable curiosity for pushing the boundaries of computer graphics.

## Completed projects

Here are some of the gems from my portfolio:

- ⚽️ [FoCo: Automatic Commentator For Robotic Football](https://github.com/rospuye/PI21-22_ComentadorFutebol): A fully automated commentator for RoboCup Simulation League games. Besides the AI knowledge, this project required a lot of web development, some tinkering with natural language processing and realistic text-to-speech technology, and a lot of computer graphics work.
- 🤖 [Robutler: Alberto, The Robotic Butler](https://github.com/RobutlerAlberto/RobutlerAlberto): A robotic system that works as a butler, which was able to execute several tasks usually undertaken by humans. This project spread over the areas of robotics, computer vision and AI.
- 🖌️ [Augmented Reality Paint](https://github.com/rospuye/PSR_ARPaint): A functioning Paint-like program that is visualized and interacted with through AR. This project required knowledge in AR and image processing.
- 🫐 [BlueberryPi: Monitorization For Blueberry Precision Agriculture](https://github.com/Dinis-Lei/BlueberryPi): A fullstack web project with the aim of providing a platform for precision farmers, through which they can control their crops, collect sensor data and manage their farms. This project required knowledge in frontend and backend development, as well as database work and UI/UX design.

## What's cookin'?

I'm currently betting on informal education and self-teaching. Here's what I'm currently up to in my after work hours...
